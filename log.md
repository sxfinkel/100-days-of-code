### Day 3: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Went through Setting up ruby on rails using Cloud9.

**Thoughts:** I had to try this a few times as the instructions were not very good when using cloud9.


### Day 4: January 11, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Went through tutorials via odinproject for using GIT via cloud9, git bash and git desktop, learning how to setup for remote, creating branch off of mainline.

**Thoughts**: Now I have a better handle of using GIT for any kind of version control.
